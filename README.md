# ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display ESP32-2432S028

ESP32 with a built in 320 x 240 2.8" LCD display with a ESP32 called the "ESP32-2432S028", We can name it "Cheap Yellow Display" or CYD for short.

## Features

The CYD has the following features:

- ESP32 (With Wifi and Bluetooth)
- 320 x 240 LCD Display (2.8")
- Without Touch Screen (Resistive)
- USB for powering and programming
- SD Card Slot, LED and some additional pins broken out

## Who is it good for?

I think it's useful for the following types of people:

- **People just getting started with working hardware** - as everything is already connected, there is no soldering or additional components required
- **People who are familiar with working with hardware, but are lazy** - (like me) Sometimes you just want to build a project without having to assemble any hardware
- **People who aren't really looking to learn anything, but just want to build some cool things** - More about this later.

## What is the purpose of this page?
Simple example to start using the CYD

## Getting Started With Your CYD

For details on how to get started with your CYD, please check out the [Setup and Configuration](/SETUP.md) page

## Code Examples

### The Basics

A collection of examples demonstrating how to use the different features of the CYD, this is a good place to get started. [Check them out here.](/Examples/Basics)

### Alternative Display Libraries

The basics examples are based on the TFT_eSPI display library, but the CYD also works with other display libraries too. Here is some example code if you prefer to use an alternative Arduino library. [Check them out here.](/Examples/AlternativeLibraries)
